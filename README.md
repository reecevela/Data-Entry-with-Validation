# Data-Entry-with-Validation

This was a fun project I did for Week 6 of my Client Side Scripting class at MCC. I went above and beyond the requirements by making it update automatically and add validation, and it's fully documented in the .js file. We weren't supposed to alter the .html file so I had to be creative and use nextElementSibling to be able to reference elements without classes or IDs.
The main thing that I learned in this project is how to be able to create and modify elements with JavaScript and use it to place them into the DOM.
